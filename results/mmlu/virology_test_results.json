Nipah is a zoonotic paramyxovirus that originated in bats. It was first identified in 1999 in Malaysia, where it caused an outbreak of encephalitis among pig farmers. The virus has since spread to other countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. In 2001, Nipah was also identified in India, where it caused an outbreak of encephalitis among fruit bats. The virus has also been identified in other countries, including Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Nipah is a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted from person to person through direct contact with infected body fluids, such as saliva, urine, or feces. It can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. The virus can cause severe illness, including encephalitis, respiratory failure, and death. There is no specific treatment for Nipah virus infection, and the best way to prevent infection is to avoid contact with infected animals and to practice good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently and thoroughly.\n        ", "parsed_output": "B", "answer": "C"}, {"question": "What is the genome structure of the polyomavirus family?", "output": " The correct answer is A.
