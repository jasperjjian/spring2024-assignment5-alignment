For example, older adults may have difficulty remembering where they put their keys or what they were supposed to do next, even though they may have the knowledge to do so. This is because they may not be aware of the strategies they can use to improve their memory, such as using visual cues or writing things down. In contrast, younger adults may have more knowledge about how their memory works and may be better able to use strategies to improve their memory.
