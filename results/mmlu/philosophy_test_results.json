Logical behaviorism is at odds with our commonsense intuition that mental states cause behavior. Logical behaviorism is a philosophical theory that holds that mental states are identical to behavioral dispositions. This means that mental states are not separate from behavior, but rather are simply dispositions to behave in certain ways. This is in contrast to our commonsense intuition that mental states are separate from behavior, and that they can cause behavior. For example, we might have the mental state of wanting to eat a piece of cake, but not actually eating the cake. In this case, our mental state of wanting to eat the cake is separate from our behavior of eating the cake. However, according to logical behaviorism, our mental state of wanting to eat the cake is identical to our behavioral disposition to eat the cake. This means that our mental state of wanting to eat the cake is not separate from our behavior of eating the cake, but rather is simply a behavioral disposition to eat the cake.

The pineal gland is the site of production and secretion of the hormone melatonin. Melatonin plays a role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm of the body, and is also involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness.
