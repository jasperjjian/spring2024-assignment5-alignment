Buying government securities risks a recessionary gap. The crowding-out effect occurs when an increase in government spending leads to a decrease in private investment. This is because the government is competing with the private sector for the same pool of resources, such as labor and capital. As a result, the private sector may choose to invest less, leading to a decrease in economic growth. To reduce the crowding-out effect, the central bank can lower interest rates, which will make it more attractive for the private sector to invest. This will increase economic growth and reduce the risk of a recessionary gap. However, lowering interest rates also carries the risk of inflation, as it can lead to an increase in the money supply.

Ceteris paribus is Latin for \"everything else remains constant.\" It is a common assumption in economics that all other factors remain constant when analyzing the effects of a particular factor. This assumption allows economists to isolate the effects of a particular factor and make predictions about its impact on the economy. For example, if we want to analyze the impact of a change in the interest rate on the economy, we would assume that all other factors remain constant, such as the level of government spending, the level of consumer spending, and the level of investment. This assumption allows us to focus on the impact of the interest rate change on the economy and make predictions about its impact. However, it is important to note that in reality, all other factors do not remain constant, and the impact of a particular factor on the economy is often complex and difficult to predict. Therefore, economists often use ceteris paribus assumptions to simplify their analysis and make predictions, but they also recognize that these assumptions are not always accurate and that the real world is much more complex than the simplified models they use.\n        ```", "parsed_output": "C", "answer": "C"}, {"question": "Suppose taxes are cut in an economy that is in equilibrium at full employment.
