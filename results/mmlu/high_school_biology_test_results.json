This is because natural selection is the process by which organisms with beneficial traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, while those with detrimental traits are less likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this process leads to the evolution of populations that are better adapted to their environments. Mutation, non-random mating, and gene flow can all contribute to evolution, but they are not as consistent as natural selection in causing populations to become better suited to their environments.\n        ", "parsed_output": "D", "answer": "D"}, {"question": "A scientist carries out a cross between two guinea pigs, both of which have black coats. Black hair coat is dominant over white hair coat. Three quarters of the offspring have black coats, and one quarter have white coats.

Which of the following statements summarizes the most likely benefits of this practice?", "output": " The correct answer is B. Crop rotation increases crop yields and soil fertility and minimizes pathogen infection and pest infestation. It also helps to prevent the buildup of pests and diseases that can damage crops. Additionally, it helps to maintain soil fertility by adding organic matter and nutrients to the soil. Finally, it helps to reduce the need for pesticides and fertilizers, which can be costly and harmful to the environment.\n        ", "parsed_output": "B", "answer": "B"}, {"question": "The base composition of DNA varies from one species to another.
