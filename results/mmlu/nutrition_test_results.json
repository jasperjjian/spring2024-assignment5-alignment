Vitamin E is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that is found in many foods, including vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and leafy green vegetables. Vitamin E is important for maintaining healthy skin, eyes, and immune system. It also helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can cause cell damage and disease. Vitamin E is also known to have anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce the risk of certain types of cancer. It is important to note that vitamin E is not a single vitamin, but rather a group of eight related compounds, including alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, and delta-tocopherol. Each of these compounds has different properties and functions in the body. In addition to its role as an antioxidant, vitamin E is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell signaling, and immune function. It is also important for the proper functioning of the nervous system and for the maintenance of healthy skin and hair. Vitamin E is available in supplement form, but it is also found in many foods, including vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and leafy green vegetables. It is important to note that vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it is stored in the body's fat tissues and can accumulate to toxic levels if taken in excess. Therefore, it is important to follow the recommended daily intake of vitamin E, which is 15 mg for adults. In conclusion, vitamin E is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes that plays an important role in maintaining healthy skin, eyes, and immune system. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell signaling, and immune function. It is important to note that vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it is stored in the body's fat tissues and can accumulate to toxic levels if taken in excess.

Vitamin B12 is most likely to be lacking in a vegan diet because it is only found in animal products. A vegan diet is a plant-based diet that excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs. Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system. It is also important for the formation of red blood cells and the maintenance of a healthy immune system. Vitamin B12 is found in animal products such as meat, fish, dairy, and eggs, but it is not found in plant-based foods. Therefore, a vegan diet is likely to be deficient in vitamin B12. This can lead to a number of health problems, including anemia, fatigue, and nerve damage. To ensure adequate vitamin B12 intake, vegans should consider taking a vitamin B12 supplement or consuming fortified foods such as plant-based milk and cereals. It is also important to note that vitamin B12 is not the only nutrient that may be lacking in a vegan diet. Other nutrients that may be lacking include iron, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids. Therefore, it is important for vegans to ensure that they are consuming a variety of plant-based foods that are rich in these nutrients. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question \"Which vitamins are most likely to be lacking in a vegan diet?\" is C. Vitamin B12. A vegan diet is likely to be deficient in vitamin B12 because it is only found in animal products.
