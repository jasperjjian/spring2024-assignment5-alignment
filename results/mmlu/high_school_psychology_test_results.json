Variance is a measure of how spread out a distribution of scores is. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each score and the mean. The larger the variance, the more spread out the distribution is. The mean, range, and median are all measures of central tendency, which is the average of a distribution. The mean is the sum of all the scores divided by the number of scores. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores. The median is the middle score when the scores are arranged in order from lowest to highest.

Taste is primarily a chemical sense. It is the sense that allows us to detect the presence of chemicals in our environment, such as the taste of food or the smell of a flower. It is one of the five senses, along with touch, sight, hearing, and smell. Taste is a chemical sense because it is triggered by the presence of chemicals in the mouth. These chemicals are detected by taste buds, which are located on the tongue and other parts of the mouth. The taste buds contain specialized cells that are sensitive to different types of chemicals, such as sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. When these chemicals come into contact with the taste buds, they trigger a response in the brain, which allows us to perceive the taste of the food or drink. Taste is an important sense for humans, as it helps us to determine the nutritional value of food and to avoid harmful substances. It also plays a role in our enjoyment of food and drink, as different tastes can evoke different emotions and memories. In addition to taste, there are other chemical senses, such as smell and olfaction, which are also important for our survival and well-being.

Turning up the volume on a music player does not change the frequency of the sound, but it does change the amplitude of the wave, which is the height of the wave. The amplitude of the wave is directly related to the loudness of the sound, so turning up the volume on a music player will increase the amplitude of the wave and thus increase the loudness of the sound. The frequency of the wave is not changed, so the pitch of the sound is not changed.

Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance by changing their attitudes, beliefs, and actions. It is this drive to reduce dissonance that can motivate behavior change. In this case, the doctor knows that smoking is unhealthy, but he continues to smoke because he believes that he can keep smoking as long as he eats healthily. This is an example of cognitive dissonance, as the doctor is holding two contradictory beliefs (smoking is unhealthy, but I can keep smoking as long as I eat healthily). The theory of cognitive dissonance suggests that the doctor will experience mental discomfort (dissonance) and will be motivated to reduce this discomfort by changing his beliefs or behavior.
