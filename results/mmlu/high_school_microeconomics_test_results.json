The law of diminishing marginal utility is most useful for explaining the law of demand. The law of diminishing marginal utility states that as more of a good or service is consumed, the marginal utility (the additional satisfaction derived from consuming one more unit) decreases.

This is important for understanding the law of demand, which states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases.
